# Bug fix log
- Fixed a bug where player can pick pits from the other player
- When player makes an invalid move, the output of the error message would be taken as an input
- When player has 0 stones in their pit, it should now correctly skip their turn
- Fixed the main.cpp file by reverting it back to its base form. Kept a local 
  version of our modified on Yoseph's machine.
- Fixed the steal move bug, and fixed it to where it works correctly.
- IMPORTANT, remember to remove the object files and the ouput binaries before we submit the final assignment.
- Fixed double move and steal move for player 2.
